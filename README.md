Lua 5.4 library to generate 32-bits cyclic redundancy checks. Code includes four pre-generated lookup tables for six different methods.

**Methods available:**
1. ISO-HDLC
1. ISCSI (supports SSE 4.2; aprox. 10x faster)
1. JAMCRC
1. MPEG-2
1. BZIP2
1. CD-ROM-EDC

## Usage

Binaries for AMD64 are available on [Releases](https://github.com/oAGoulart/libluacrc32/releases) page. For x86, compile with gcc or use `build.sh` script. If on Windows, use MinGW/MSYS2 with `CFLAGS` and `LFLAGS` set to include and library paths, respectively.

```sh
env CFLAGS=-IC:/Users/a_gou/scoop/apps/lua/5.4.7-2/include \
    LFLAGS=-LC:/Users/a_gou/scoop/apps/lua/5.4.7-2/bin ./build.sh
```

**NOTE:** If you want to use MSVC, you are on your own, sorry.

Then, require and call with a string to calculate its CRC. First and second arguments of `calculate` are `strings`, the latter is which method to use.

```lua
local crc32 = require("libluacrc32")

print(crc32.calculate("wrappem", "ISCSI"))
-- output: 969553473
```

**NOTE:** If the Lua code above fails with `module 'libluacrc32' not found` on Windows, add `package.cpath=".\\?.dll"` one line before `require` or change your `LUA_CPATH` environment variable to include `.\\?.dll`.
